# Used AWS (IAM, S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, Batch, EC2, ECR, Step Functions) to optimize portfolios using Monte Carlo Simulations

## High Level Architecture: Leveraged AWS services to preprocess financial data, run large-scale parallel simulations, analyze risk-return profiles, and identify optimal asset allocationsâ€”all orchestrated through serverless workflows
1. Fetch and process historical financial data
3. Run monte-carlo simulations to model future portfolio outcomes
